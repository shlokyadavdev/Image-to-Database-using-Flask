# Image-to-Database-using-Flask
A base level project which marked my entry into the domain of web development. At the core level, this project can be remodelled to turn any image into a potential database. However, to demonstarte its working, I chose to go with the theme of the result systems in the academic field. 

<h2><b> Overview </b></h2>
The essential delieverable of the project comes as a website which will provide aid to teachers and professors. It works on report cards and attendence systems. Often times, both of them are recorded over a sheet of paper and teachers have to read the  digits off paper or on another document and enter it in an excel sheet. That manual labor is taken away of doing that activity is taken away. All that needs to be done is, a screenshot of the report card needs to be uploaded over the portal and the database in the form of a csv file is generate and stored at a specified location. The model to detect handwritten text is still yet to be added however, hence the website would work only on screenshots of report cards and not actual handwritten text. The development of the model to detect handwritten text is still under works.
